`bootstrap.pytorch` is a high-level extension for deep learning projects with PyTorch.
It aims at accelerating research projects and prototyping by providing a powerful workflow focused on your dataset and model.

And it is:

- Scalable
- Modular
- Shareable
- Extendable
- Uncomplicated
- Built for reproducibility
- Easy to log and plot anything

Unlike many others, `bootstrap.pytorch` is not a wrapper over pytorch, but a powerful extension.

## Quick tour

To run an experiment (training + evaluation):
```
python -m bootstrap.run
       -o myproject/options/sgd.yaml
```

To display parsed options from the yaml file:
```
python -m bootstrap.run
       -o myproject/options/sgd.yaml
       -h
```

Running an experiment will create 4 files, here is an example with [mnist](https://github.com/Cadene/mnist.bootstrap.pytorch):

- [options.yaml](https://github.com/Cadene/bootstrap.pytorch/blob/master/docs/assets/logs/mnist/sgd/options.yaml) contains the options used for the experiment
- [logs.txt](https://github.com/Cadene/bootstrap.pytorch/blob/master/docs/assets/logs/mnist/sgd/logs.txt) contains all the information given to the logger
- [logs.json](https://github.com/Cadene/bootstrap.pytorch/blob/master/docs/assets/logs/mnist/sgd/logs.json) contains the following data: train_epoch.loss, train_batch.loss, eval_epoch.accuracy_top1, etc
- <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cadene/bootstrap.pytorch/master/docs/assets/logs/mnist/sgd/view.html">view.html</a> contains training and evaluation curves with javascript utilities (plotly)


To save the next experiment in a specific directory:
```
python -m bootstrap.run
       -o myproject/options/sgd.yaml
       --exp.dir logs/custom
```

To reload an experiment:
```
python -m bootstrap.run
       -o logs/custom/options.yaml
       --exp.resume last
```

We use flake8 to perform early semantic checking of submitted code. After installing all the requirements in requirements.txt, please run the following to activate the pre-commit hooks for flake8:
`pre-commit install`

To manually trigger the pre-commit checks for a file without creating a commit, you can run the following command: `pre-commit run --files <your_files.py>`
